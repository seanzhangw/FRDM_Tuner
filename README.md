# Project Descriptions for Team asg246-sb926

We are thinking of doing a smart home automation system. We can design a system that controls lighting or temperature within a house. We can use sensors for presence detection to automate lighting or temperature control and integrate Wi-Fi or Bluetooth for remote monitoring and control.## sb926
