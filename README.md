# Project Descriptions for Team aj447-sg852-smw356

## aj447
We will design a video game controller for a space invaders game. The player will play as the spaceship and be able to steer the ship left or right along the screen by holding the board left and right. Aliens will come down from the top of the screen and it is the players job to kill them before they reach the ground. To shoot at an alien, the player needs to get the ship below the alien and shoot by pressing one of the buttons on the board.## sg852
