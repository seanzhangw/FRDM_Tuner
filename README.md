# Project Descriptions for Team ath58-mjb529

## ath58
For my project, I have a general idea of implementing a brick-breaker-like game, which utilizes the inbuilt accelerometer in the FRDM in order to control the player's paddle at the bottom of the screen. Depending on how much the player tilts the board (and given that it is oriented correctly), the paddle should corresponding move in the direction of the tilt, and hopefully, with a velocity corresponding to the degree of tilt. Depending on if I get a teammate, I would be interested in adding additional functionality to the game or to the controller.## mjb529
