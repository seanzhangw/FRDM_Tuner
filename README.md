Final Project Proposal 1: Digital Compass
-----------------------------------------

Objective
---------

The objective of this project is to create a Digital Compass using the on-board magnetometer sensor. The compass will utilize Earth's magnetic field to determine and display the cardinal directions (North, South, East, West) on an LCD display. This project aims to introduce the basics of Earth's magnetism, sensor integration, and digital display technology.

Materials
---------

* FRDM-KL25Z

* On-board magnetometer sensorÂ 

* LCD display

Challenges and Solutions
------------------------

* Calibration: We can have an intuitive calibration process for users, potentially guided by on-screen instructions.

* Magnetic Interference: Design the project to minimize interference (e.g., keeping electronic components spaced apart) and instruct users on how to use the device away from metallic objects.

* Power Management: Optimize software for portable use.

Learning Outcome

We will gain experience with sensor integration, learn about Earth's magnetism, and how digital compasses work.## nsn8
