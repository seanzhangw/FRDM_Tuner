For our project, we would like to simulate a coloring game. Basically, given a shape and time limit, the "player" has to color in the entire shape under the given time limit. With each new level, the shapes become more complex, the time limit decreases, and the draw stroke (if it is possible to implement this) gets smaller, so as to make the game more challenging with each new level.
