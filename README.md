Our final project will be a classic game of Connect 4. Player 1 starts the game. The 4-Digit Segment LCD will show who’s turn it is to play. The coin always starts on the right side for both Player 1 and Player 2, and the player has the option of moving the coin to where they want it dropped using the Capacitive Touch Slider. Once Player 1 is satisfied with the slot that they want to drop the coin in, they can press the SW1 button. This triggers the system to know that it is Player 2’s turn. They control the SW2 button, and they also use the Capacitive Touch Slider. If Player 1 or Player 2 gets four coins in a row (diagonal, horizontal, or vertical), they win the game and the 4-Digit Segment will display that this player won. We are still deciding whether to use an external LED matrix or a computer monitor to represent our grid. The Reset button will reset the game, regardless of how far the game has progressed.
