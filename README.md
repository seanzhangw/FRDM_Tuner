# Project Descriptions for Team aab274-bwo9-gls242

## aab274
Our idea is to replicate "Space Shooter - Galaxy", a video game where players participate in an intergalactic war where they must control a spacecraft to prevent an alien invasion. Using the FRDM-KL46Z board's accelerometer, pilots will navigate their ships by tilting the board in various directions, As players progress through the game's waves of enemies, they can collect and use several unique an power-ups that we have placed throughout the game. These power-ups range from shield enhancements and weapon upgrades to speed boosts and bombs. The goal is for each power-up to give the player a slight advantage as they progress. Players must also confront bosses that test the skills they've developed. These power-ups range from shield enhancements and weapon upgrades to speed boosts and bombs.

We plan on focusing on intuitive user controls and exciting features that will enhance the overall experience.## bwo9
