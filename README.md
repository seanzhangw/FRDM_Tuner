# Project Descriptions for Team cap337-tjd224

## cap337
Led sequence memorization. Kind of like the game where you have to remember a pattern and replay it and the pattern gets increasingly more difficult.## tjd224
"LED Sequence Memory Game" using the FRDM board. This game would utilize the board's LEDs and buttons to create an interactive experience that tests and enhances the player's memory skills. The project concept is as follows:

* Develop a game where the FRDM board's LEDs light up in a specific sequence, and the player must replicate the sequence using the buttons on the board.

* Start with simple sequences and gradually increase complexity as the player successfully reproduces sequences, adding more steps and quicker succession to challenge the player further.

* Use a mix of the board's available LEDs to create visually stimulating patterns and sequences, making the game not only a test of memory but also of the player's ability to quickly and accurately respond to visual cues.

* Implement a scoring system based on the number of sequences correctly replicated, with the potential to reset or offer hints after a certain number of failed attempts to keep the game engaging and not overly frustrating.
