# Project Descriptions for Team az385-flp23

## az385
For our project, we hope to recreate a simpler version of the Bop It game. The user will be tasked to react with a given action depending on the boards output. To start, we will use the LED’s colors to indicate what action the user should take. For example, if the LEDs show RED, then the user should push a button. If the LED shows GREEN, then the user needs to tilt the board in a certain direction. ## flp23
