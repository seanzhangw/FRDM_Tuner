We want to create a reaction based game that uses the LEDs on the board and the buttons. Essentially, we’ll turn on an LED and the first player to click their button wins a point. The first player to a certain number of points wins. We can indicate different situations using different LED colors, such as when player 1 wins instead of player 2 we flash the color red.## chl72
