# Project Descriptions for Team cc2466-swz9

## cc2466
We are planning on doing an instrument tuner, which has two modes: an emitting and listening mode. For emitting, the tuner would be able to set the frequency of the pitch and the volume with the capacitive touch sensor. For listening, it would take sound input and detect the frequency to tell users if they need to be sharper or flatter. We might also create some sort of GUI for the tuner.## swz9
