# Project Descriptions for Team ar933-jmd476

## ar933
I would like to build a basic version of a home security system. I would use the sensors to detect potential intrusions or unsafe conditions in a home environment. I would use motion detectors and the on-board accelerometer to detect unusual vibrations or movements, alerting homeowners through LCD display notificationss.## jmd476
