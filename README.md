In this project, the idea is to create a solar-powered light structure that can change intensity according to the light intensity of the room and also switch the LED level of intensity depending on whether an object has passed through or not such as when a car passes through a street light. The project will be constructed in a a form of street lights using LEDs and tested using different light intensities and objects passing near or further from the street lights.
