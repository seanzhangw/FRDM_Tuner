Our objective for this project is to implement an interactive game based on the classic “Simon Says” using an embedded system that lights up a series of LEDs in a random order, and the player must replicate that order using a set of input buttons. This challenges a person to remember and replicate a sequence of lights, red, green, blue, and white.## yl3558
Our objective for this project is to implement an interactive game based on the classic “Simon Says” using an embedded system that lights up a series of LEDs in a random order, and the player must replicate that order using a set of input buttons. This challenges a person to remember and replicate a sequence of lights, red, green, blue, and white.

We expect that our game to generate (random uniformly) a color between red, green, blue, and white each round and flash it, alongside the previous lights, if any and in order. The game will expect the player to replicate the pattern of lights using the push buttons connected to the Arduino. The game is over when there is a mistake.
