# Project Descriptions for Team al2356-ipr6-yz2437

## al2356
## ipr6
We envision developing a memory recall game using the board (like bop it). This would be implemented by having each color of led (red, green, blue) correspond to a button on the FRDM microcontroller. The leds will flash in some order and the player will be expected to press the corresponding buttons in the correct order. We envision the current score and high score also being displayed using the LCD on the board.## yz2437
