# Project Descriptions for Team atu2-qh229-tc543

## atu2
Our group is creating a sensor for robots that automatically stops them during earthquakes and lets them move again when it's safe, controlled by a joystick. This sensor detects ground movements in real-time, ensuring the robot pauses to avoid damage during tremors. Once the earthquake passes, operators can guide the robot to continue its rescue or support tasks. This project combines safety and control, making these robots invaluable for disaster response efforts.## qh229
