# Project Descriptions for Team cc2466-swz9

## cc2466
We are planning on doing an instrument tuner, which has two modes: an emitting and listening mode. For emitting, the tuner would be able to set the frequency of the pitch and the volume with the capacitive touch sensor. For listening, it would take sound input and detect the frequency to tell users if they need to be sharper or flatter. We might also create some sort of GUI for the tuner.## swz9

# Feedback

I think this is a great idea. You will need two external components, a microphone and a small speaker. Instead of a PC hosted GUI, you could use colors or the two LEDs (one for flat, one for sharp).  To start off, pick one of the two modes. It can still a a successfulll project with only one of them working. 

You'll also need some FFT code to analyze the microphone signal. 

# Project Web-Page

The project web-pages will also be hosted on github in this repo in the "page" branch. You can edit it by switching branches and modifying the files, or by pushing to the branch. Here is a link to a minmal web-page that you can edit and modify: [https://pages.github.coecis.cornell.edu/ece3140-sp2024/cc2466-swz9](https://pages.github.coecis.cornell.edu/ece3140-sp2024/cc2466-swz9)
