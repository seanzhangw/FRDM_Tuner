# Project Descriptions for Team ar738-rn258-sav65

We will use the FRDM board to create a video-game controller. I am still not sure whether we will use the board to control a game that will be displayed on the board itself (such as interacting with blinking lights or displaying something onto the LCD display, etc.) or a game that will be displayed onto a computer screen if we connect the board and it's controls to a PC, most likely the first. One possible idea is to create a time-reaction game similar to whack-a-mole in which the user tries to hit one of the FRDM board buttons as fast as they can after a light that we control (with random timing) lights up. We can display the current score of the user on the LCD display as well. We can control their score in a way that if the user hits the button right before we flash the light (indicating a false start) we decrement their point. These are the peripherals we are thinking of utilizing.## rn258
