# Project Descriptions for Team ays48-twm59

## ays48
We would like to create a plug and play tetris game using the board. This will be done by allowing the player to use the touch slider to move the pieces around and the buttons to rotate the piece. The board will act as a controller and interface with a python program running tetris.## twm59
