# Project Descriptions for Team anb78-kjs294-yc698

## anb78
We plan to use a traffic light simulation system, with one of the boards signaling the north-south direction and the other board signaling the east-west direction. Our goal is to make this mimic real-life traffic light situations with some additional features added. Some additional features we plan to include are using the sensors on the board in order to simulate high-traffic density and accordingly differently for low-traffic density. We have provided more information in the next section below.## kjs294
