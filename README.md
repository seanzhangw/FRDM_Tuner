Our project involves recreating the iconic game Brick Breaker, where players control a paddle to bounce a ball and break bricks arranged in various patterns. The game will feature intuitive controls, engaging levels, and vibrant visuals, aiming to capture the nostalgic essence of the original while introducing modern elements to enhance gameplay experience. Player will be using the board to move the bottom brick.## wo52
We will use the capacitative touch slider to create an interactive game. Something like brick breaker or any similar game ideas that requires a sliding motion.
