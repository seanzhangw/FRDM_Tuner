# Project Descriptions for Team az392-nsg67-tic4

## az392
Our project proposal is a music controller. Essentially, the board will be used to communicate with a basic app that connects to the Spotify API to control how music is playing. We'll use the on-board accelerometer, buttons, slider, and gyroscope to implement a set of commands (button press commands, tilt commands, etc.) that control the music player. We can also display certain statuses (e.g. volume, time elapsed) on the LCD segment display and LEDs.## nsg67
