# Project Descriptions for Team ak2246-clw233-jwc279

## ak2246
Our project is an implementation of a stock exchange order book, where multiple exchange customers are constantly sending in bids (buy) and asks (sell) orders into our central exchange and we fulfill and exchange these struct requests using C. We display important information like when a sell order comes in using LEDs (green for buy order, red for sell orders). We process concurrent orders as threads and employ the concurrency topics of semaphores & conditional locks that we learned in lecture to handle requests.## clw233
