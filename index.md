# Best Instrument Tuner!!!
#### Overview
We built an instrument tuner that has two modes: a speaker and listening mode. For listening, it would take sound input and detect the frequency to tell users if they need to be sharper or flatter. An extra microphone sensor is used to take in the signal and analyze. For speaker mode, the tuner would be able to set the frequency of the pitch and the volume with the capacitive touch sensor. In addition, the board will also support a metronome function that can play at different tempo.

In order to allow input from users to play different notes and tempo, a GUI is implemented that contains the frequency and notes played, and a display that shows the current frequency listened to. There will also be an ideal frequency of the closest note to compare to.

#### Technical Approach
Our listening mode listens to notes, analyzes the frequency of a note, and displays the detected note and the pitch offset on a GUI display. To detect the pitch of notes, we need to select a microphone with a sampling frequency high enough to accurately capture frequencies in the 16-5000 range (frequencies of common notes). Integrating a microphone into the FRDM board involves processing the analog input into a digital value. To accomplish this, we use the microcontrollerâ€™s built-in ADC. With access to a buffer of digital values that represent the sound wave, we use the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to perform frequency analysis on the wave. The sound wave frequency is then compared to the frequency of the closest half-note. This half-note is then sent to the connected computer via UART and displayed on a GUI. An indicator on the display also shows whether the note is sharp or flat. 

For the speaker mode, the microcontroller will use UART to connect with serial pins on laptop to send frequency and volume to play at, and the laptop can read the information provided. It will then be connected to a python script for GUI to play the frequencies on laptop speaker.
